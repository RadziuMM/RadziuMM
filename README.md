# Hi, I'm Radek and I'm a computer wizard :fireworks:

## About Me
 
Most of the time I code in .js or .ts ,but I also know python, c++, php and some java.

Also, I'm a database hound ... SQL, noSQL, graphQL etc.

I play around with Linux a lot(I use Arch btw.), you should be able to find my configuration here.

I can also do penetration testing, but I find it tedious, so I'm not likely to become a hacker.
